This is [Tennix's](https://github.com/tennix) Emacs configuration file.

I use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] and [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] to manage my init.el

Packages I strongly suggest are
* magit: no need to explain
* vterm: with this I can live in Emacs without running external terminal
* flycheck
